This project intends to simplify the sysupgrade process of devices running OpenWrt or
distributions based on the former like LibreMesh. The provided tools here offer an easy
way to reflash the router with a new version or package upgrades, without the need of
`opkg` installed.

Additionally it offers an API (covered below) to request custom images with any
selection of packages pre-installed, allowing to create firmware images without the need
of setting up a build environment, even from mobile devices.

## Clients

### [`luci-app-attendedsysupgrade`](https://github.com/openwrt/luci/tree/master/applications/luci-app-attendedsysupgrade)

Add a view to the Luci system tab called "Attended Sysupgrade". Offers a button to search for updates and if found, to flash the image created by the update server.

### [`auc`](https://github.com/openwrt/packages/tree/master/utils/auc)

Add CLI to perform sysupgrades. Makes use of `ucert` to verify images are from a trusted source.

### [Chef Online Builder](https://github.com/libremesh/chef)

-   <https://chef.libremesh.org>

## Server

The server listens to update and image requests and images are automatically generated
if the requests was valid. This is done by automatically setting up OpenWrt
ImageBuilders and cache images in a database. This allows to quickly respond to
requests without rebuilding existing images again.

### Active server

-   [chef.libremesh.org](https://chef.libremesh.org)
-   [as-test.stephen304.com](https://as-test.stephen304.com) **unstable dev server**

You can set this server in `/etc/config/attendedsysupgrade` after installation of a
client.

## Run your own server

It's fairly easy to run your own _asu_ server! You can test it locally via Docker,
Vagrant or Ansible. The following steps except you are familiar with either Docker,
Vagrant or Ansible.

### via Docker

Make sure to have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed. Simply execute the server via
the following command:

    docker-compose up

This will start a postgres container preseeded with the required database schema.
Afterwards a server is started which performs an initial download of available versions
and target/subtarget combinations. Once this is done the server itself is started via
`gunicorn3`.

A worker container waits for the server to come up (on port 8000) and will start
builders, garbage collectors and an updater.

The folders `worker` and `updater` are created, caching downloaded ImageBuilders. You
can change this behaviour in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### via Ansible

Copy the configuration file from `./asu/utils/config.yml.default` to
`./ansible/host_vars/<hostname>.yml`. Add the Ansible variables `ansible_host` and
`ansible_user` to the top of the config file.

Change all settings as you like, the config file is automatically copied to the host
folder `<server_dir>/config.yml`.

### via Vagrant

Make sure your vagrant environment is setup and supports the used Debian 9 image
(virtualbox/libvirt). Also [Ansible](https://ansible.com) is requred to setup the
service. To start vagrant simply run the following command:

    vagrant up

Ansible automatically starts to setup the postgres database, server and worker.  Once
installed two systemd services are running, called `asu-server` and `asu-worker`. Check
their well beeing via `journalct -fu asu-*`.

Ansible takes the configuration file from `./asu/utils/config.yml.default` or a specific
one, if exists, from `./ansible/host_vars/<hostname>.yml`.

## Development

To hack on the server, please install it manually. The following steps give an (may
incomplete) overview on the required steps. It's focused on Debian based system, feel
free to add documentation for other systems.

### Required packages

The server requires the following packages

    apt install python3-pip odbc-postgresql unixodbc-dev gunicorn3 git \
        bash wget postgresql

To run the worker addiditonal packages are required, based on the [official
wiki](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/quickstart-build-images)

    apt install subversion g++ zlib1g-dev build-essential git python rsync \
        man-db libncurses5-dev gawk gettext unzip file libssl-dev wget zip

### Install the server package

Run `pip3` to install the package

    pip3 install -e .

This allows `gunicorn3` and `flask` to find the package.

### Setting up PostgreSQL

As `asu` uses [ODBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Database_Connectivity)
you have to add the servers database to your `.odbc.ini` or `/etc/odbc.ini`. See
an example configuration [here](contrib/odbc.ini). Once added setup the
PostgreSQL user account. From a root shell login as postgres, create the `asu`
database and change the password!

    su postgres
    createdb asu
    psql
    create role asu with password 'changeme' nosuperuser nocreatedb nocreaterole noinherit login noreplication nobypassrls;
    grant all privileges on database asu to asu;


Now let flask initiate the database and load available targets.

    export FLASK_APP=asu
    flask initdb
    flask loaddb

The server and worker(s) are now ready to run!

### Starting the server

Either start the server in single thread mode via `flask` or via `gunicorn3`

    # runs on localhost:5000
    FLASK_APP=asu
    flask run

    # runs on localhost:8000
    gunicorn3 asu:app

### Starting the worker

Simply run the following command to run the worker, it will start multiple threads for
updating, cleaning and building firmware images:

    FLASK_APP=asu
    flask run-worker

## API

### Upgrade check `/api/upgrade-check`

Sends information about the device to the server to see if a new distribution version or
package upgrades are available. An _upgrade check_ could look like this:

| key         | value                                                          | information                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `distro`    | `OpenWrt`                                                      | installed distribution      |
| `version`   | `17.01.0`                                                      | installed version           |
| `target`    | `ar71xx/generic`                                               | installed target            |
| `installed` | `{ "libuci-lua": "2017-04-12-c4df32b3-1", "cgi-io": "3", ...}` | all user installed packages |

Most information can be retrieved via `ubus call system board`. Missing information can
be gathered via the `rpcd-mod-rpcsys` package. `packages` contains all user installed
packages plus version. Packages installed as an dependence are excluded as they've been
automatically and dependencies may change between versions.

It's also possible to check for a new version without sending packages by removing
`installed` from the request.

### Response `status 200`

The server validates the request. Below is a possible response for a new version:

| key        | value                                                                                       | information                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `version`  | `18.06.2`                                                                                   | newest version                                   |
| `upgrades` | `{ "luci-lib-jsonc": [ "git-17.230.25723-2163284-1", "git-17.228.56579-209deb5-1" ], ... }` | Package updates `[new_version, current_version]` |
| `packages` | `[ "libuci-lua", "cgi-io", ... ]`                                                           | All packages for the new image                   |

See [other status codes](#response-status-codes)

An version upgrade does not ignore package upgrades for the following reason.
Between versions it possible that package names may change, packages are dropped
or merged. The _response_ contains all packages included changed ones.

The _upgrade check response_ should be shown to the user in a readable way.

### Upgrade request `/api/upgrade-request`

Once the user decides to perform the sysupgrade a new request is send to the
server called _upgrade request_.

#### POST

| key        | value                             | information                              |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `distro`   | `OpenWrt`                         | installed distribution                   |
| `version`  | `18.06.2`                         | installed version                        |
| `target`   | `ar71xx/genreic`                  | installed target                         |
| `board`    | `tl-wdr4300-v1`                   | `board_name` of `ubus call system board` |
| `packages` | `[ "libuci-lua", "cgi-io", ... ]` | All packages for the new image           |

The _upgrade request_ is nearly the same as the _upgrade check_ before, except only
containing package names without version and adding `board` and possibly `model`. While
the server builds the requested image the clients keeps polling the server sending a
`request_hash` via `GET` to the server.

#### GET

If the `request_hash` was retrieved the client should switch to `GET` requests with the
hash to save the server from validating the request again.

`api/upgrade-request/<request_hash>`

### Response `status 200`

| key            | value                                                          | information                 |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `files`        | `/json/openwrt/18.06.2/ar71xx/generic/ap121f/812744035616fc9/` | path where files are stored |
| `sysupgrade`   | `openwrt-18.06.2-8127440...ric-ap121f-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin` | name of sysupgrade file     |
| `log`          | `/download/openwrt/18.06...16fc9/buildlog-347d575ed2ca2f1.txt` | path to build log           |
| `image_hash`   | `347d575ed2ca2f1`                                              | hash of the image           |
| `request_hash` | `f6560b451837`                                                 | hash of the request         |

See [other status codes](#response-status-codes)

### Build request `/api/build-request`

It's also possible to request to build an image. The request is nearly the same as for
`upgrade-request`. The response only contains a link to the created `files` or
`upgrade-request` parameters if available.

An additional parameter is the `defaults` parameter which allows to set the content of
`/etc/uci-defaults/99-server-defaults` within the image. This allows to set custom
options for the resulting image. To distinguish between custom images the name will
contain a hash of the requested `defaults` value and is stored in a different place,
only visible if the full hash (32bit) is known.

This is a special case for clients that do not necessary require a sysupgrade compatible
image. An example is the [LibreMesh Chef](https://chef.libremesh.org) firmware builder.

### Response status codes

The client should check the status code:

### Request data

It's also possible to receive information about build images or package versions,
available devices and more. All responses are in `JSON` format.

-   `/api/image/<image_hash>` Get information about an image. This contains various
    information stored about the image.

-   `/api/manifest/<manifest_hash>` Get packages and versions of a manifest. The
    manifest contains all installed packages of an image. The `manifest_hash` can be
    received by the api call `/api/image`.

-   `/api/distros` Get all supported distros with latest version and a short description
    if available.

-   `/api/versions[?distro=<distribution>]` Get all supported versions with short
    description (of a singele distribution if given).
